    <h3>Future Nostalgia</h3>
    <p class="inst-meta">2021 – 2022 &nbsp;/&nbsp; with Nadja Kracunovic, Denis Lee, Dean Ruddock</p>
    <div class="inst-body">
      <div class="inst-text">
        <p>The project was presented as the radio show "Future Nostalgia FM," installations called "Eavesdropshop" and "Futurology Kiosk," and as the digital platform futurenostalgia.digital.</p>
        <p><strong>Future Nostalgia FM</strong> is an experimental, imaginary radio station combining speculative storytelling, poems, sounds, and audio that overlap eras — from the distant past to the possible future. Its narrative wavers between speculations, aspirations, alternative versions, and perspectives of reality. It was exhibited on the walls of the Footnote Center in Belgrade and played on Theaterplatz during the Kultursymposium Weimar 2021.</p>
        <p><strong>Eavesdropshop:</strong> The walls of the Stasi building in Leipzig are invaded by a fictional inventory — objects meant to be used for hearing the sound of the future, nostalgia, and social dreaming.</p>
        <p><strong>Futurology Kiosk:</strong> Settled in a small GDR kiosk, the installation presents a distortion of our timeline where past, present, and future suddenly collide. Combining sound, installation, and performative objects, its futuristic experience speculates on the future through conceptually designed broken ceramics — excavations from the future bringing nostalgia for what has never happened.</p>

    <h3>Schlosserzählen #3</h3>
    <p class="inst-meta">2023 &nbsp;/&nbsp; with Eunike Kramer &nbsp;/&nbsp; Stadtschloss Weimar</p>
    <div class="inst-body">
      <div class="inst-text">
        <p>The radio artists Eunike Kramer and David Bilek contribute to the urban outdoor space with their audio installation, offering various perspectives on the palace and its history. Passersby on the streets of Weimar associate different impressions with the Residenzschloss — for some it resembles an unopened black box, others carry personal memories of events that took place there.</p>
        <p>Their expressions are accompanied by a composition of sounds from the palace itself. Arriving in the present, the palace also demands a critical stance: must we preserve our symbols of authority? And whose version of the past should be told in the present?</p>
        <p>The audio installation could be heard daily in the passage to the courtyard of the city palace.</p>
